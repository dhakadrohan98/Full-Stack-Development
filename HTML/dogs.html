    <h1>Dog</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also
        called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct gray wolves,[6][7] and the gray wolf is the dog's closest
        living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be domesticated[9][8] by humans. Experts estimate that
        hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago in Oberkassel, Bonn,[7] which was before the
        development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number
        of domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for
        other canids.[11]

        The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
        attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as
        hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and
        aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the humanâ€“canine
        bond has been a topic of frequent study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of
        "man's best friend".</p>
